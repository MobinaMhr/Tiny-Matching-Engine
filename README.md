Software-Engineering-Course-S2024

This repository contains the implementation of a Matching Engine with Java programming language. The Matching Engine facilitates the processing of buy and sell orders in a stock exchange market.

- ## [CA3](https://github.com/MobinaMhr/TinyME/blob/main/project-descriptions/SE1S03-A3-Description.pdf). Unit Test 
Developed comprehensive unit tests to verify the correctness and reliability of core matching engine functionalities.

- ## [CA4](https://github.com/MobinaMhr/TinyME/blob/main/project-descriptions/SE1S03-A4-Description.pdf). Minimum Execution Quantity 
Implemented Minimum Execution Quantity (MEQ) functionality to ensure orders meet minimum quantity requirements upon entry.

- ## [CA5](https://github.com/MobinaMhr/TinyME/blob/main/project-descriptions/SE1S03-A5-Description.pdf). Stop Limit Order 
Added support for Stop Limit Orders, which activate when the last traded price reaches a specified stop price.

- ## [CA6](https://github.com/MobinaMhr/TinyME/blob/main/project-descriptions/SE1S03-A6-Description.pdf). Technical Debt 
Addressed technical debt accumulated in the previous phases to enhance overall system performance and maintainability.
Auction Matching

- ## [CA7](https://github.com/MobinaMhr/TinyME/blob/main/project-descriptions/SE1S03-A7-Description.pdf). Auction Matching 
Introduced Auction Matching, allowing orders to be placed directly into the order book without immediate matching, suitable for specific market conditions.

- ## [CA8](https://github.com/MobinaMhr/TinyME/blob/main/project-descriptions/SE1S03-A8-Description.pdf). Code smells and Improving Design 
Conducted refactoring to improve code structure and readability, aligning with best practices in software design.
