# SE1-S2024-Tiny-Matching-Engine

Software-Engineering-Course-S2024

This repository contains the implementation of a Matching Engine with Java programming language. The Matching Engine facilitates the processing of buy and sell orders in a stock exchange market.

- ## [CA1](). JMS Bank Application
In this assignment, we were supposed to implement a simple JMS application using Spring Boot and Artemis. The application is a simple Bank application that uses JMS to send and receive messages.

- ## [CA2](). Code Review
This assignment was about code review and refactoring. We were given a simple Java application as `TinyME` (a simple matching engine) and we were supposed to review the code and refactor it.

- ## [CA3](https://github.com/MobinaMhr/TinyME/blob/main/project-descriptions/SE1S03-A3-Description.pdf). Unit Testing
In this assignment, we were supposed to add complementary unit tests to the `TinyME` application to increase the code coverage. The tests were supposed to be written using JUnit and Mockito to verify the correctness and reliability of core matching engine functionalities.

- ## [CA4](https://github.com/MobinaMhr/TinyME/blob/main/project-descriptions/SE1S03-A4-Description.pdf). Minimum Execution Quantity 
In this assignment, we were supposed to add a feature to the `TinyME` application. The feature was to add a minimum execution quantity to the orders. The feature was supposed to be implemented in a way that the existing tests would not fail. This feature shows that an order will be moved into the order book only if the quantity of the order is greater than or equal to the minimum execution quantity. 

- ## [CA5](https://github.com/MobinaMhr/TinyME/blob/main/project-descriptions/SE1S03-A5-Description.pdf). Stop Limit Order 
In this assignment, we were supposed to add a new type of order to the `TinyME` application. The new order type is called `Stop Limit Order`, which activate when the last traded price reaches a specified stop price.

- ## [CA6](https://github.com/MobinaMhr/TinyME/blob/main/project-descriptions/SE1S03-A6-Description.pdf). Technical Debt 
In this assignment, we were supposed to refactor the `TinyME` application to remove the technical debt, since the last version of the application was not well-designed. The technical debt was supposed to be removed in a way that the existing tests would not fail.

- ## [CA7](https://github.com/MobinaMhr/TinyME/blob/main/project-descriptions/SE1S03-A7-Description.pdf). Auction Matching 
In this assignment, we were supposed to add a new feature to the `TinyME` application. The new feature was to add an auction mechanism to the application, which allows orders to be placed directly into the order book without immediate matching, suitable for specific market conditions.

- ## [CA8](https://github.com/MobinaMhr/TinyME/blob/main/project-descriptions/SE1S03-A8-Description.pdf). Code smells and Improving Design 
In this assignment, we were supposed to conduct refactoring to improve code structure and readability in `TinyME` application, aligning with best practices in software design. The design was supposed to be improved in a way that the existing tests would not fail.
